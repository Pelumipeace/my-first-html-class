            dogs are exceptional for simply being dogs. They are social acrobats
            that can find social harmony wherever they go. They have rich
            emotional lives in which they co-exist with different species and
            can even forge bonds outside of their own species.

            Cats are believed to be the only mammals who don't taste sweetness.
            Cats are nearsighted, but their peripheral vision and night vision
            are much better than that of humans. Cats are supposed to have 18
            toes (five toes on each front paw; four toes on each back paw). Cats
            can jump up to six times their length.

            Many fish have excellent vision and can see colors. They also have
            nostrils and are able to detect odors in water. Fish may or may not
            have teeth, depending on the species. Another organ of sense unique
            to fish is called the lateral line, located along the side of the
            fish.

            One of the most interesting facts about birds is that they have
            hollow bones, which is why it's easy for them to fly. Scientists
            believe that birds are descendants of theropod dinosaurs and have
            been around for millions of years. A group of birds is called a
            flock. Some birds, like parrots, can mimic what people say.
